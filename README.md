## ðŸš€ Getting Started

**The app targets iOS 17 and above. Make sure you have Xcode 15+ installed.**

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jus3472/EV-Connect.git
```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

```sh
cd EV-Connect
```

3. Open the project in Xcode:

```sh
open EV-Connect.xcodeproj
```

4. Set Up Firebase:

This project uses Firebase for authentication and other services. To run the app locally, you need to set up your own Firebase project and obtain the necessary configuration file ('GoogleService-Info.plist').

Steps to Set Up Firebase:
1. Go to the Firebase Console.
1. Create a new Firebase project.
1. In the Firebase Console, add an iOS app.
1. Enter your app's **Bundle ID** (e.g., 'com.yourname.EV-Connect') which is found in "Signing and Capabilites" in the '.xcodeproj' file, and register the app.
1. Download the generated 'GoogleService-Info.plist' file.
1. Place the 'GoogleService-Info.plist' file in the **Xcode project folder** (at the same level as 'Assets.xcassets', etc). Without this file, the app will not build or connect to Firebase services properly.
1. In Xcode, with your app project open, navigate to **File > Add Packages** and enter the provided Firebase iOS SDK repository URL. Select the latest SDK version. Add all of the Firebase libraries (**Note: You may not need all libraries but adding them won't affect performance.**).

5. To build and run the app, select a simulator or connected iOS device and press:

```sh
Cmd + R
```
